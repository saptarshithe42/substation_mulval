CVE-2024-47136
Out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in Kostac PLC Programming Software (Former name: Koyo PLC Programming Software) Version 1.6.14.0 and earlier. Having a user open a specially crafted project file which was saved using Kostac PLC Programming Software Version 1.6.9.0 and earlier may cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, arbitrary code execution, and/or information disclosure because the issues exist in parsing of KPP project files.

CVE-2024-45368
The H2-DM1E PLC's authentication protocol appears to utilize either a custom encoding scheme or a challenge-response protocol. However, there's an observed anomaly in the H2-DM1E PLC's protocol execution, namely its acceptance of multiple distinct packets as valid authentication responses. This behavior deviates from standard security practices where a single, specific response or encoding pattern is expected for successful authentication.

CVE-2024-43099
The session hijacking attack targets the application layer's control mechanism, which manages authenticated sessions between a host PC and a PLC. During such sessions, a session key is utilized to maintain security. However, if an attacker captures this session key, they can inject traffic into an ongoing authenticated session. To successfully achieve this, the attacker also needs to spoof both the IP address and MAC address of the originating host which is typical of a session-based attack.

CVE-2024-41716
Cleartext storage of sensitive information vulnerability exists in WindLDR and WindO/I-NV4. If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker who obtained the product's project file may obtain user credentials of the PLC or Operator Interfaces. As a result, an attacker may be able to manipulate and/or suspend the PLC and Operator Interfaces by accessing or hijacking them.
